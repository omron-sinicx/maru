      **"maru" (= miniature assemblage adaptive robot unit)** is a custom-made, miniature-sized, two-wheeled robot designed specifically for tabletop swarm robotics research. This platform enables researchers and hobbyists to explore the dynamics of swarm robotics in a controlled, tabletop environment.

      The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/omron-sinicx/swarm-body) serves as a comprehensive resource for assembling and operating maru, providing detailed documentation and files, including:
        - `hardware/3Dmodel` 3D models of the robot and its cradle (a combined communication and charging module),
        - `hardware/circuit/schematic` Circuit schematics to guide the electronic assembly,
        - `hardware/circuit/gerber` Gerber files for PCB manufacturing,
        - `software/firmware Firmware` for both the robot and the cradle, distributed in binary format (Note: There are currently no plans to release the source code),
        - `software/control` APIs and sample codes to help you get started with programming the robot for various tasks and behaviors (C# and Python).

      This project draws inspiration from [Zooids](https://github.com/ShapeLab/SwarmUI), an open-source swarm robot platform. Similar to Zooids, maru employs projection-based position tracking; however both maru's hardware and software are entirely new designs, another platform for swarm robotics research in HCI.
  - title: Hardware
    image: robot_exploded.png
    text: |
      The hardware design is shown above. The dimensions are 30 mm in diameter and 34 mm in height, weighing about 23 g. The robot parts include a microcontroller unit (STM32G071KBU62 from STMicroelectronics), motor drivers (DRV8837DSGR3 from Texas Instruments), RF module (RF2401F204 from NiceRF), motors with a 26:1 planetary gearbox (Pololu 23575), photodiode (PD15-22C/TR86 from Everlight Electronics), and a 40mAh Li-Po battery.

      Since the robot is lightweight, the robot may fall over while moving if the moving speed is too fast. Magnets can be attached to the bottom of the robot, and the robot can be run on steel or other materials to keep it from falling over.

      A detailed description of the hardware design and specifications is available [here](https://shigeodayo.notion.site/Hardware-Manual-maru-8442a3ade0ba457dba1eb5f8b898ae2d).
  - title: Software
    image: robot_communication.png
    text: |
      The communication between the robots and the host computer is shown above. The robots and the cradles (charging station + RF/IO dongle) are each equipped with an RF module and communicate through a 2.4GHz ISM band wireless communication. The user does not need to be aware of the communication control between the robot and the cradles, as it is performed on the firmware of both devices. The user can easily control the robot wirelessly by sending the specified commands.

      A detailed description of the software design and specifications is available [here](https://shigeodayo.notion.site/Software-Manual-maru-53adfd3b5a8c482b9a2acadc83991381).
  - title: Projection-based Localization
    text: |
      A projection-based localization system used for the Zooids was used to track the robots. A high-speed projector (DLP LightCrafter 4500 from Texas Instruments) was used to project a sequence of gray-coded patterns onto the table; the two photodiodes on the robot received the projected coded-pattern light, and the microcontroller of the robot decoded its pattern into position information. Then, the robot calculated its orientation from the positions of two photodiodes and broadcasted its position and orientation information to the host computer.

      For instructions on the projector tracking system, see https://github.com/ShapeLab/SwarmUI/tree/master/Hardware/Projector%20Tracking%20Setup
